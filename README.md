character pool is consisted of 4 sub-pools: lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols.
Depending on the answers given by the user regarding the composition of the password, the character pool is assembled with some or all of these 4 arrays by a 3-level if-loop.
the index number of the character pool array is generated by Math.random()
each character selected from character pool this way is then placed into a new array
a string of the password is generated by using array.join("")
